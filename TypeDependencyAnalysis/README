## Overview =======================================
This is a program which analyze the dependency relationship among code files.

## Commands ======================================

./Debug/Exec.exe [\R] "Directory path" [file pattern: "*.cpp", "*.h" etc.] [file pattern 2] ...

By specificing \R, we will search sub-directories under the path specificed.

If not specific file pattern, *.h will be used by default

## Files changed =====================================

ADD ActionsAndRulesExtended.h / .cpp (an extension of existing rules & actions.  I want to keep ActionsAndRules.h unchanged)
ADD Main.cpp (the entry point of this program)
ADD StringHelper.h / .cpp (a helper class used to format string)

CHANGE ConfigurationParser.h / .cpp (create & pass graph instance)
CHANGE Graph.h / .cpp (extend the graph class, add functor, add search ability by specific vertex value or edge value)
CHANGE ActionAndRules.h / .cpp (re-write some actions, changed a little bit)
